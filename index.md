## Our Data Futures

We're a Toronto-based grassroots organization focused on sparking conversation around how digital data is being collected, used, stored, handled for privacy, combined, shared, and kept accurate.

We want to hear from all Torontonians: how does digital data affect your everyday life?

### Our vision

We want to move the conversation from “what governments and corporations want for data” to “what people want” and to move the decision-making influence into the hands of the people — people whose data is being collected, used, stored, handled for privacy, combined, shared, and kept accurate.

### Purpose statement

The people of Toronto need a grassroots way to participate in modifying the rules of data governance, because consultations and conversations are currently framed to meet the desires of corporations and governments, rather than the needs of everyday people.
